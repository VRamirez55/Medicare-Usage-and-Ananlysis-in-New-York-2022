My project focuses on analyzing Medicare utilization across different hospital counties in New York State, emphasizing demographic factors such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity, and their impact on key hospital metrics like length of stay and types of admissions. Included in the repository are my preliminary analysis, final report, data dictionary, and SQL queries. Additionally, a link to my Tableau dashboard and presentation provides visual insights and a comprehensive overview of the findings.
